# Sparce Feature-Based Reconstruction

> Reconstruct key points in a scene from multiple images using feature-based techniques.

The FURN and SURF feature descriptors (from OpenCV) are used to match keypoints across multiple images. These are then reprojected into 3D space with the use of both the camera intrinsic and extrinsic information.
